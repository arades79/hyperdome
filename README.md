# Hyperdome

The safest place to reach out

## Concept

An anonymous, asymmetrical, and distributed conversation application. Composed of a server and client component. The server is lightweight and will allow administrators to add sign ins for various forms of counsel. A counselor would use the client to sign into a server, and a guest would connect to the server without credentials to be matched to a counselor.

This allows people to reach out anonymously and privately with some form of guarantee from the server administrators that the counselor the guest is talking to is qualified. Additionally the client allows multiple servers to be added, meaning multiple forms of counsel can be saught, or a counselor could also be a guest in other servers.

## Use Cases

The primary use case is mental health services. University campuses or businesses can provide their students/employees anonymous access to qualified therapists. This avoids the embarassment many feel about reaching out, and is much more convenient.

Other use cases could involve law firms providing a portal for people to seek legal advice, giving users a preview of the legal counsel the firm provides without needing to provide explicit attorney client priviledge.
